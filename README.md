#Splits 


## Overview
Splits is a decentralized application that allows users to manage shared expenses using stablecoins (USDC). Users can interact with an AI model to create and modify expense splits, upload receipts for analysis, and process payments seamlessly.


### Backend
- The backend is designed to handle AI-related requests and health checks without maintaining a database.
- Key components include:
  - **AI Router**: Manages routes for AI queries and responses.
  - **Health Router**: Provides a health check endpoint.
  - **Services**: Interact with the 0G Compute API and handle image processing tasks.

## Getting Started
